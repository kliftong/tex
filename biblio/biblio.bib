	abstract = {Satellite-based precipitation estimates have great potential for a wide range of critical applications, but their error characteristics need to be examined and understood. In this study, six (6) high-resolution, satellite-based precipitation data sets are evaluated over the contiguous United States against a gauge-based product. An error decomposition scheme is devised to separate the errors into three independent components, hit bias, missed precipitation, and false precipitation, to better track the error sources associated with the satellite retrieval processes. Our analysis reveals the following. (1) The three components for each product are all substantial, with large spatial and temporal variations. (2) The amplitude of individual components sometimes is larger than that of the total errors. In such cases, the smaller total errors are resulting from the three components canceling one another. (3) All the products detected strong precipitation ({\textgreater}40 mm/d) well, but with various biases. They tend to overestimate in summer and underestimate in winter, by as much as 50\% in either season, and they all miss a significant amount of light precipitation ({\textless}10 mm/d), up to 40\%. (4) Hit bias and missed precipitation are the two leading error sources. In summer, positive hit bias, up to 50\%, dominates the total errors for most products. (5) In winter, missed precipitation over mountainous regions and the northeast, presumably snowfall, poses a common challenge to all the data sets. On the basis of the findings, we recommend that future efforts focus on reducing hit bias, adding snowfall retrievals, and improving methods for combining gauge and satellite data. Strategies for future studies to establish better links between the errors in the end products and the upstream data sources are also proposed.},

	abstract = {The sparse rain gauge networks over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) cause challenges for hydrological studies and applications. Satellite-based precipitation datasets have the potential to overcome the issues of data scarcity caused by sparse rain gauges. However, large uncertainties usually exist in these precipitation datasets, particularly in complex orographic areas, such as the TP. The accuracy of these precipitation products needs to be evaluated before being practically applied. In this study, five (quasi-)global satellite precipitation products were evaluated in two gauge-sparse river basins on the TP during the period 1998\&ndash;2012; the evaluated products are CHIRPS, CMORPH, PERSIANN-CDR, TMPA 3B42, and MSWEP. The five precipitation products were first intercompared with each other to identify their consistency in depicting the spatial\&ndash;temporal distribution of precipitation. Then, the accuracy of these products was validated against precipitation observations from 21 rain gauges using a point-to-pixel method. We also investigated the streamflow simulation capacity of these products via a distributed hydrological model. The results indicated that these precipitation products have similar spatial patterns but significantly different precipitation estimates. A point-to-pixel validation indicated that all products cannot efficiently reproduce the daily precipitation observations, with the median Kling\&ndash;Gupta efficiency (KGE) in the range of 0.10\&ndash;0.26. Among the five products, MSWEP has the best consistency with the gauge observations (with a median KGE = 0.26), which is thus recommended as the preferred choice for applications among the five satellite precipitation products. However, as model forcing data, all the precipitation products showed a comparable capacity of streamflow simulations and were all able to accurately reproduce the observed streamflow records. The values of the KGE obtained from these precipitation products exceed 0.83 in the upper Yangtze River (UYA) basin and 0.84 in the upper Yellow River (UYE) basin. Thus, evaluation of precipitation products only focusing on the accuracy of streamflow simulations is less meaningful, which will mask the differences between these products. A further attribution analysis indicated that the influences of the different precipitation inputs on the streamflow simulations were largely offset by the parameter calibration, leading to significantly different evaporation and water storage estimates. Therefore, an efficient hydrological evaluation for precipitation products should focus on both streamflow simulations and the simulations of other hydrological variables, such as evaporation and soil moisture.},

Recent satellite-based precipitation products provide important alternative sources of data for such applications, yet their quality and applicability with respect to extreme precipitation have not been studied sufficiently. In this study, the performances of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B42 and Global Precipitation Measurement Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals (GPM IMERG) data in extreme precipitation estimation were evaluated over China. Both annual maximum precipitation and extreme rainfall events exceeding the 90th percentile were examined and compared with gauge measurements for the periods of 2000–2017 and 2014–2017. It was found that: (1) both satellite products captured the spatial pattern of extreme precipitation well over China with an overall underestimation for extreme rainfall rate and an overestimation for annual total extreme precipitation volume; (2) TRMM 3B42 data had limited ability to detect extreme rainfall events, while GPM IMERG performed slightly better; (3) both products produced good estimation of extreme precipitation with short-medium recurrence intervals, but exhibited consistent underestimation at all return periods; (4) GPM IMERG outperformed TRMM 3B42 for nearly all evaluation metrics when compared over the same time period; (5) the performances were better in south and east China with humid monsoon climate, than in arid west China with high altitude, indicating a significant influence of topography and climate. Our results indicated high potential of satellite products to represent the spatial pattern, overall volume and probability characteristics of extreme precipitation over China, and revealed the general superiority of GPM IMERG to TRMM 3B42. Meanwhile, more studies are still needed to validate data in regions with complex topography and dry climate, and further improve the retrieval algorithm to better support disaster risk reduction and other hydrological applications, especially in areas with a sparse gauge network.},

The satellite-based precipitation products show similar spatial patterns with varying degrees of overestimation or underestimation, compared with the gauged precipitation. A distributed hydrological model is used to evaluate the suitability of satellite-based precipitation products in simulating streamflow, evapotranspiration and soil moisture. The simulations of streamflow and evapotranspiration forced by the MSWEP precipitation perform best among the five satellite-based precipitation products, where the Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) between the simulated and observed streamflow ranges from 0.75 to 0.91, and the KGE between the simulated and observed evapotranspiration ranges from 0.46 to 0.61. However, the KGE between the simulated and observed soil moisture is negative, indicating that the performance of soil moisture simulation forced by satellite-based precipitation is poor. In addition, this study finds the spatial pattern of simulated streamflow is dominated by the distribution of precipitation, whereas the distribution of evapotranspiration and soil moisture is controlled by the parameters of the hydrological model. This study is useful for the improvement of hydrological modeling based on remote sensing and the monitoring of regional water resources.},

Furthermore, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), a widely used semi-distributed hydrological model, is calibrated using different precipitation inputs. Both model performance and uncertainties of parameters and prediction have been quantified. The following findings were obtained: (1) The MSWEP and TMPA precipitation products have good accuracy with higher CC, POD, and lower ME and RMSE, and the AgMERRA precipitation estimates perform better than PERSIANN-CDR in this rank; and (2) out of the six different climate regions of MRB, all six metrics are worse than that in the whole MRB. The AgMERRA can better reproduce the occurrence and contributions at different precipitation densities, and the MSWEP has the best performance in Cwb, Cwa, Aw, and Am regions that belong to the low latitudes. (3) Daily streamflow predictions obtained using MSWEP precipitation estimates are better than those simulated by other three products in term of both the model performance and parameter uncertainties; and (4) although MSWEP better captures the precipitation at different intensities in different climatic regions, the performance can still be improved, especially in the regions with higher altitude.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT In situ rainfall data observed by gauges is the most important data in water resources management. However, these data have some limitations both spatially and temporally. With the advancements in satellite rainfall products, it is now possible to evaluate whether these products can capture the climatology of known rainfall characteristics. In this study, five satellite rainfall estimates (SREs) were evaluated against gauge data based on different rainfall regimes over Iran. The evaluated SREs are Climate Prediction Center Morphing Technique, Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN) and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), PERSIANN Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CDR) and the most recently available Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP) data. The performance of these five SREs is evaluated with respect to gauge data (total: 958 stations) in eight different climatic zones at daily, monthly, and wet/dry spells during a ten-year period (2003?2012). Performance of SREs was evaluated using metrics of comparison based on correlation coefficient (CC), root mean square error, and relative error. The study shows that MSWEP has the highest CC (0.72) followed by TRMM (0.46) and PERSIANN-CDR (0.43) at daily time scale. The performance of SREs varies with respect to climatic regimes, for example, the best correlation was observed in the south, the shore of Persian Gulf with ?very hot and humid? climate with CC values of 0.72, 0.70, and 0.82 for MSWEP, TRMM and PERSIANN-CDR, respectively. Further, the performance of SREs was evaluated using the categorical statistics to capture the rainfall pattern based on different groups (e.g. light, moderate and heavy rainfall events). Results show that MSWEP, PERSIANN-CDR, and TRMM performed well to distinguish rain from no-rain condition, whereas for higher rainfall rates, PERSIANN-CDR outperforms the other SREs.},

	abstract = {Spatial and temporal variability in extreme rainfall, and its interactions with land cover and the drainage network, is an important driver of flood response. “Design storms,” which are commonly used for flood risk assessment, however, are assumed to be uniform in space and either uniform or highly idealized in time. The impacts of these and other commonly-made assumptions are rarely considered, and their impacts on flood risk estimates are poorly understood. This study presents an alternate framework for rainfall frequency analysis that couples stochastic storm transposition (SST) with “storm catalogs” developed from a ten-year high-resolution (15-min, 1-km2) radar rainfall dataset for the region surrounding Charlotte, North Carolina, USA. The SST procedure involves spatial and temporal resampling from these storm catalogs to reconstruct the regional climatology of extreme rainfall. SST-based intensity–duration–frequency (IDF) estimates are driven by the spatial and temporal rainfall variability from weather radar observations, are tailored specifically to the chosen watershed, and do not require simplifying assumptions of storm structure. We are able to use the SST procedure to reproduce IDF estimates from conventional methods for four urban watersheds in Charlotte. We demonstrate that extreme rainfall can vary substantially in time and in space, with potentially important flood risk implications that cannot be assessed using conventional techniques. SST coupled with high-resolution radar rainfall fields represents a useful alternative to conventional design storms for flood risk assessment, the full advantages of which can be realized when the concept is extended to flood frequency analysis using a distributed hydrologic model.},

Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curves are often used for hazard modeling but require long records to describe the distribution of rainfall depth and duration and do not provide information regarding rainfall space-time structure, limiting their usefulness to small scales. In contrast, RainyDay can be used for many hazard applications with 1–2 decades of data, and output rainfall scenarios incorporate detailed space-time structure from remote sensing. Thanks to global satellite coverage, RainyDay can be used in inaccessible areas and developing countries lacking ground measurements, though results are impacted by remote sensing errors.

The HAND model normalizes topography according to the local relative heights found along the drainage network, and in this way, presents the topology of the relative soil gravitational potentials, or local draining potentials. The HAND model has been demonstrated to show a high correlation with the depth of the water table, providing an accurate spatial representation of soil water environments. Normalized draining potentials can be classified according to the relative vertical flowpath-distances to the nearest drainages, defining classes of soil water environments. These classes have been shown to be comparable and have verifiable and reproducible hydrological significance across the studied catchment and for surrounding ungauged catchments. The robust validation of this model over an area of 18,000 km2 in the lower Rio Negro catchment has demonstrated its capacity to map expansive environments using only remotely acquired topography data as inputs. The classified HAND model has also preliminarily demonstrated robustness when applied to ungauged catchments elsewhere with contrasting geologies, geomorphologies and soil types. The HAND model and the derived soil water maps can help to advance physically based hydrological models and be applied to a host of disciplines that focus on soil moisture and ground water dynamics. As an original assessment of soil water in the landscape, the HAND model explores the synergy between digital topography data and terrain modeling, presenting an opportunity for solving many difficult problems in hydrology.},

	abstract = {Over the last decades, general circulation model (GCM) simulations have been regularly evaluated in terms of their ability to reproduce the historical frequency of significantly recurrent weather patterns (WP) observed at the regional scale. Thus, a good simulation of the frequency of these particular WP by the GCM is generally conditioning the good representation of the regional statistics of surface variables such as temperature and precipitation. In this paper, the seasonal frequency of eight particular WP have been calculated using the daily geopotential height fields simulated by an ensemble of 26 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) GCM. These WP are known as significantly influencing the French regional hydro?climatology in terms of both frequency of low?flows and high?precipitation events. Four different bias correction methods have been applied on the simulated geopotential height fields before the calculation of the seasonal WP frequencies. The GCM ensemble showed overall good performances in terms of the simulation of WP seasonal frequencies. The application of a spatially and temporally non?homogenous correction of simulated geopotential height fields improved significantly the simulation of WP frequencies for the four seasons. Finally, the evolution of the WP frequencies over the next century has been quantified. Three WP (WP2, WP4 and WP8) have pronounced seasonal changes, with WP2 and WP4 being less frequent in summer and autumn seasons, respectively, while WP8 being more frequent over spring, summer and autumn seasons. The strong simulated frequency evolution of WP2 and WP8 is an interesting result, which predicts the climate to be drier with time for France. Thus, WP2 (western oceanic circulation), grouping rainy days over the northern France region, is simulated as less frequent in future summers, while WP8 (anticyclonic situations), which groups non?rainy days over France, is simulated as more frequent in future summers.},

	abstract = {A new technique is presented in which half-hourly global precipitation estimates derived from passive microwave satellite scans are propagated by motion vectors derived from geostationary satellite infrared data. The Climate Prediction Center morphing method (CMORPH) uses motion vectors derived from half-hourly interval geostationary satellite IR imagery to propagate the relatively high quality precipitation estimates derived from passive microwave data. In addition, the shape and intensity of the precipitation features are modified (morphed) during the time between microwave sensor scans by performing a time-weighted linear interpolation. This process yields spatially and temporally complete microwave-derived precipitation analyses, independent of the infrared temperature field. CMORPH showed substantial improvements over both simple averaging of the microwave estimates and over techniques that blend microwave and infrared information but that derive estimates of precipitation from infrared data when passive microwave information is unavailable. In particular, CMORPH outperforms these blended techniques in terms of daily spatial correlation with a validating rain gauge analysis over Australia by an average of 0.14, 0.27, 0.26, 0.22, and 0.20 for April, May, June–August, September, and October 2003, respectively.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} Current global precipitation (\textit{P}) datasets do not take full advantage of the complementary nature of satellite and reanalysis data. Here, we present Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP) version 1.1, a global \textit{P} dataset for the period 1979\&ndash;2015 with a 3-hourly temporal and 0.25° spatial resolution, specifically designed for hydrological modeling. The design philosophy of MSWEP was to optimally merge the highest quality \textit{P} data sources available as a function of timescale and location. The long-term mean of MSWEP was based on the CHPclim dataset but replaced with more accurate regional datasets where available. A correction for gauge under-catch and orographic effects was introduced by inferring catchment-average \textit{P} from streamflow (\textit{Q}) observations at 13{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}762 stations across the globe. The temporal variability of MSWEP was determined by weighted averaging of \textit{P} anomalies from seven datasets; two based solely on interpolation of gauge observations (CPC Unified and GPCC), three on satellite remote sensing (CMORPH, GSMaP-MVK, and TMPA 3B42RT), and two on atmospheric model reanalysis (ERA-Interim and JRA-55). For each grid cell, the weight assigned to the gauge-based estimates was calculated from the gauge network density, while the weights assigned to the satellite- and reanalysis-based estimates were calculated from their comparative performance at the surrounding gauges. The quality of MSWEP was compared against four state-of-the-art gauge-adjusted \textit{P} datasets (WFDEI-CRU, GPCP-1DD, TMPA 3B42, and CPC Unified) using independent \textit{P} data from 125 FLUXNET tower stations around the globe. MSWEP obtained the highest daily correlation coefficient (\textit{R}) among the five \textit{P} datasets for 60.0{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}\% of the stations and a median \textit{R} of 0.67 vs. 0.44\&ndash;0.59 for the other datasets. We further evaluated the performance of MSWEP using hydrological modeling for 9011 catchments (\&lt;{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}50{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}000{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}km$^{\textrm{2}}$) across the globe. Specifically, we calibrated the simple conceptual hydrological model HBV (Hydrologiska Byråns Vattenbalansavdelning) against daily \textit{Q} observations with \textit{P} from each of the different datasets. For the 1058 sparsely gauged catchments, representative of 83.9{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}\% of the global land surface (excluding Antarctica), MSWEP obtained a median calibration NSE of 0.52 vs. 0.29\&ndash;0.39 for the other \textit{P} datasets.
